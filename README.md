### Usage

1. Place your OpenVPN client configuration in `client.conf` 
1. Optionally, add the line: `auth-user-pass /opt/openvpn/auth.txt` and place your OpenVPN authentication details in `auth.txt`
1. Run the container with:

    ```sh
    #!/bin/bash
    docker run \
        --name cto \
        --rm -it \
        --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
        --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun \
        -p 3000:3000 \
        -v $(pwd)/auth.txt:/opt/openvpn/auth.txt \
        -v $(pwd)/client.conf:/opt/openvpn/client.conf \
        -v $(pwd)/downloads:/opt/cloud-torrent/downloads \
        jpillora/cloud-torrent-openvpn
    ```

1. Confirm everything works (the logs should say `Initialization Sequence Completed`), then re-run the above with `--rm -it` swapped for `-d --restart always`

### Extras

* To start `cloud-torrent` with custom command-line options, replace `/scripts/cloud-torrent.sh`
